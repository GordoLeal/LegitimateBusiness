# Super Simeon Autos
Current Version: <code>1.2a</code>

Super Simeon Autos is a mod for Grand Theft Auto V  that lets you collect and deliver (almost all) vehicles to specific locations on the map.

## Requirements
* Game Version: Grand Theft Auto V [version 1.27](https://github.com/TwosHusbandS/Project-127/) (Legacy). This mod is only tested without issues with version 1.27.
* ScriptHookV: Install the latest version of [ScriptHookV](https://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) as the mod was developed using it.
* Returning Player Bonus: Required for all vehicles to function properly. The game will still launch without it, but vehicle collection may be impacted. (can be toggled on/off in the Project 1.27 launcher)

## Installation
1. Ensure your game is running GTA V version 1.27. If you need to downgrade, follow the [Project-127 Downgrade Guide](https://github.com/TwosHusbandS/Project-127/blob/master/Installer/Info/Help.md).
2. Install the latest version of [ScriptHookV](https://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/).
3. Download the latest release of Super Simeon Autos from the [Releases](https://github.com/GordoLeal/SuperSimeonAutos/releases) page.
4. Place the downloaded .asi file in the root of your GTA V installation directory.
5. Launch the game and load a save file to generate the <code>SSA_Settings.txt</code> configuration file.

## How to play
**Objective**: Locate vehicles across the map ([vehicles guide available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLy1r_IYJAnth6uyUSzunOT0c65c5wLdxrW01GbjFZA/edit?usp=sharing)) and deliver them to highlighted delivery points.

**Customizable Settings**: Upon loading a save, the SSA_Settings.txt file is created, allowing you to:
* Disable specific delivery points during missions like DLG, Complications, and Franklin & Lamar to customize your experience.
* Adjust other options to customize gameplay to your preferences.

**Vehicle Tracking**: Hold the Get in Cover and Reload Weapon buttons for 5 seconds to display a list of vehicles you have delivered and those still missing from your collection.
