# Super Simeon Autos

Super Simeon Autos is a mod for Grand Theft Auto V  that lets you collect and deliver (almost all) vehicles to specific locations on the map.

## Requirements
* Game Version: Grand Theft Auto V [version 1.27](https://github.com/TwosHusbandS/Project-127/) (Legacy). This mod is only tested without issues with version 1.27.
* ScriptHookV: Install the latest version of [ScriptHookV](https://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) as the mod was developed using it.
* Returning Player Bonus: Required for all vehicles to function properly. The game will still launch without it, but vehicle collection may be impacted. (can be toggled on/off in the Project 1.27 launcher)

## Installation
1. Ensure your game is running GTA V version 1.27.to downgrade follow the [Project-127 Downgrade Guide](https://github.com/TwosHusbandS/Project-127/blob/master/Installer/Info/Help.md).
2. in Project 1.27: Enable "Returning Player Bonus" in Settings -> GTA & Launch Settings -> Tick the "Enable ReturningPlayerBonus" box
3. in Project 1.27: Enable "ScriptHook on Downgraded GTA" in Settings -> GTA & Launch Settings -> Tick the "ScriptHook on Downgraded GTA" box
4. Install the latest version of [ScriptHookV](https://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/).
5. Download the latest release of Super Simeon Autos from the [Releases](https://github.com/GordoLeal/SuperSimeonAutos/releases) page.
6. Place the downloaded .asi file in the root of your GTA V installation directory.
7. Launch the game and load a save file to generate the <code>SSA_Settings.txt</code> configuration file.

## How to play
**Objective**: Locate vehicles across the map ([vehicles guide available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLy1r_IYJAnth6uyUSzunOT0c65c5wLdxrW01GbjFZA/edit?usp=sharing)) and deliver them to highlighted delivery points.

**Customizable Settings**: Upon loading a save for the first time the SSA_Settings.txt file is created, allowing you to enable/disable up to 4 delivery points: Del Perro Pier, Simeon, Lighthouse and Lifeguard Tower. (Lifeguard is disabled by default)

*Mod Creator recommendation: If you want the same experience as the mods from the 3D era games, enable ONLY the **Del Perro Pier** and **Lighthouse** as delivery points in SSA_Settings.txt.
If you want a chill and fast experience, keep all the options as default.

Other small options inside the SSA_Settings.txt are also available for you to adjust your gameplay.

**Vehicle Tracking**: Hold the "Get in Cover" and "Reload Weapon" buttons for 5 seconds to generate a txt file inside the game folder with a list of vehicles you have delivered and those still missing from your collection.
